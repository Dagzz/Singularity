# Singularity

Singularity is an experimental portfolio project designed for exploration and fun. Featuring disabled scrolling, users can navigate through space and unlock hidden stories. The project emphasizes sound design and incorporates multilingual translations where words are abstract and require interpretation. Centered around the concept of singularity, including themes like space and AI, Singularity aims to provide an immersive and interactive experience. Future updates will include additional functionalities and improved code organization.
